# Personalized To Do List

## V1
As a refresher to working with HTML and CSS, we'll be creating a personalized `To Do List` with an `About Me` page that has a short biographical description.  It can be fictional if you want.

## V2
Create a `To Do list` with an HTML template that will display an unordered list, a header, and tasks. You are not limited in tags so ensure to be creative and have fun in order to get familiarized with HTML.

### Run a python webserver
From the command line, in the same directory that your `index.html` file lives in, run `python -m http.server`. This will run the python http server module from the command line, and if you go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) you will see your index.html website!

Put `index.css` and other files your html page may fetch in the same directory.

## V3
Take the To Do List you created earlier and add style for visual appeal and create a method that allows users to complete a task (i.e. cross out the task, create a checkmark for a task).  Let's also add a contact form to your `About Me` page

## V4:  Integrating APIs

Let's now incorporate at least two 3rd-party APIs.  The sky's the limit.
Here is a list of some free APIs that don't require any sign-up.  That should get you started, but you are free to try any other API you might come across.

Feel free to deviate from the `To Do List` format at this point.  If it makes sense to replace your `To Do List` with another type of list, such as a list of blog articles, a list of recipes or cat facts, etc., go ahead and make those changes.
